# Weather & Facts

## Description
Duration: one evening

This small app was built out to practice using APIs. Local Minneapolis weather is received, then the high and low daily temperatures are sent to a Numbers API to get number facts. The 'Today in History' box is getting a random on-this-day fact from a history API. There is also a message on how to dress that is dependent on the temperature.
